gtfs notes:


    when using the google schedule viewer, when you click on a route, the 'yellow markers' are stops on that trip

    but the yellow markers are also stops, so if you view the exact same area with a different route selected
    there will be a blue stop marker instead of a yellow marker (aka the yellow marker is overlapping the blue marker)



routes contain 1 or more trips

    trips contain 1 or more stops


        has a shape

        has the concept of a "trip pattern" where a group of trips that visit the same stops in the same order)
            this is basically like the 9 bus route East versus the 9 bus route West

            there are 67 trips for West and 68 trips for East, but all of those follow the same pattern
            so there are really just 2 Trip patterns


        uses stop_times.txt , via the 'trip_id' field to list the stops in order (stop_sequence)


stops are just their own thing, multiple routes/trips can hit the same stop.
