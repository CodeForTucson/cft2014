gtfs notes:



routes contain 1 or more routes

    trips contain 1 or more stops


        has a shape

        has the concept of a "trip pattern" where a group of trips that visit the same stops in the same order)
            this is basically like the 9 bus route East versus the 9 bus route West

            there are 67 trips for West and 68 trips for East, but all of those follow the same pattern
            so there are really just 2 Trip patterns


        stops are where you get on / off


            has a stop time
