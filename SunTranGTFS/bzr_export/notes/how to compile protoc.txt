how to compile protoc on my linux server


git clone https://github.com/openx/python3-protobuf.git
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME
# wait....
make
make check
make install
# done


TO ACTUALLY USE IT IN THE PYTHON APP:

you need the pypi package "python3-protobuf"

however you need to install it in the system level, aka not though --user or else it won't find it
cause its running python as a different user then you are!!!
